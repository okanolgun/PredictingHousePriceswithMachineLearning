# PredictingHousePriceswithMachineLearning 

How much has the real estate market in America risen since 2008? What is the effect of inflation on these prices? Would house prices still rise even if inflation had not occurred? How have the house prices changed over the years?

Currently, there is a real estate crisis in China, which has also greatly affected the global economy.

Below the link, you can find my project work, where I used this crisis process and different data collected since 1944, analyzed and interpreted them, and trained them with the 'RandomForest' machine learning model.
